I wanted to find some trends of different streaming services across various countries. 
# My first step was to download data online and save it as a CSV. I found a dataset that provided insight into music streaming trends from 2018 to 2024 across multiple platforms, including Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. It includes listener demographics, streaming habits, genre preferences, and engagement metrics.
# I made sure the date in CSV was clean and there were no duplicates and missing values in the data. I used a basic Excel filter to ensure the quality of the data was clean before looking to upload it into PG Admin.
# I then defined the structure of my tables and created the table in PG Admin, and then after that, I imported the CSV into. 

Created a table first in PG Admin using the syntax below then followed on by uploading the CSV file after making the table
